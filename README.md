# Characterizing-Smart-Contract-Evolution
This is the implementation script and data open-source repository for the paper "Characterizing Smart Contract Evolution." We have organized all our result data and running scripts throughout the process.

Due to GitHub file size limits, we have uploaded larger datasets to Google Drive. We will indicate the data URLs in the corresponding sections of the README file.
